    "### **Dataset Structure**\n",
    "- **Rows (Samples)**: Each row represents a **single corn sample**.\n",
    "- **Columns (Features)**:\n",
    "  1. **\"hsi_id\"** (Column 1) → A unique identifier for each sample.\n",
    "  2. **448 Spectral Reflectance Features** (Columns 2 to 449) →  \n",
    "     - These columns contain **reflectance values** at different **wavelength bands**.\n",
    "     - The values range between **0.26 and 0.95**.\n",
    "  3. **\"vomitoxin_ppb\"** (Column 450) → **Target Variable**  \n",
    "     - Represents the **DON concentration (in ppb)** for each sample.\n",

    "### **Understanding Spectral Reflectance Features**\n",
    "- The **448 spectral features** correspond to reflectance values recorded at different **wavelength bands**.\n",
    "- Reflectance is the proportion of **light reflected** by the corn sample at specific wavelengths.\n",

    "- DON (**Deoxynivalenol**) is a **toxic mycotoxin** produced by fungi in corn.\n",
    "- High DON levels indicate **contaminated corn**, which is dangerous for **human and animal consumption**.\n",

    "- ### **EDA & Feature Engineering**\n",
    "    - During EDA We observe that in our data set No missing value present \n",

    "    - This is one of the challange I have faced that is to handle this outlier\n",
    "    - I have uses IQR method to remove the outlier\n",
    "    - Then I have applied Standarization and Normalization on the Spectral data && Visualize spectral bands\n",
    "    - I tried to visualize spectral reflectance curves for random corn samples across multiple wavelength bands.\n",
    "      The curves indicate variation in reflectance values, which may be useful for distinguishing samples with different DON concentrations.\n",
